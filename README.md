## Introduction:<a name="introduction"></a>

In today's world, payment systems have become an integral part of our daily lives. We use payment systems for everything from buying groceries to do payment for even the smallest of things. However, traditional payment systems often come with their own set of drawbacks which includes slow payment settlement and high fees. Fortunately, with the advent of [Blockchain Technology](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/blockchain/?aws-products-all.sort-by=item.additionalFields.productNameLowercase&aws-products-all.sort-order=asc), a new solution has emerged: the [Celo blockchain](https://docs.celo.org/learn/celo-highlights). In this tutorial, we will explore how the Celo blockchain can solve the problems of slow payment settlement and high fees.

## How Celo Works?

The [Celo protocol](https://docs.celo.org/learn/celo-highlights) provides a platform upon which the Celo community can create stabilized value digital assets. Named for the currencies they follow, Celo Dollars (cUSD) and Celo Euros (cEUR) are stablecoins that allow anyone to share value faster, cheaper and more easily from a mobile phone.

## Blockchain based Finance Vs. Traditional Banking:

| Blockchain based Finance | Traditional Banking |
| --- | ----------- |
|1. No intermediaries involved. |1. Transactions are facilitated by the banks.  |
|2. Supply is determined by an algorithm known as Smart Contract and is known for years to come.   |2. Supply is determined by central banks of respected currencies and may change depending on the debt issued.  |
|3. Cross border payments can be done in a few minutes. |3. Cross border payments may up to a week take. |
|4. KYC/AML is not necessary, if the transfer is made from person to person. |4. Have to pass KYC/AML if you want to utilize banking services. |
|5. Cross border payment comission may be counted in few cents per transaction in some cases. |5. SWIFT ($15-$45); ACH ($3); SEPA (free, but some banks charge) |

## The Problems with Traditional Payment Systems:<a name="The_Problems_with_Traditional_Payment_Systems"></a>

Traditional payment systems are centralized, which means that they are controlled by a single entity such as a bank or a payment processor. This creates several problems like follows:

1. **Slow payment settlement:** It can take several days to settle a payment. This is because payments have to go through several intermediaries like the banks and payment processors, before they can be settled.

2. **High fees:** They often charge high fees for cross-border payments. This is because banks and payment processors charge fees for their services and these fees can add up quickly.

3. **Lack of financial inclusion:** They exclude people who do not have access to banking services. This is because banks often require a minimum balance or credit score to open an account, which can make it difficult for people with low incomes or no credit history to access financial services.

## How Celo Blockchain Solves the Problems ?<a name="How_Celo_Blockchain_Solves_the_Problems"></a>

[The Celo blockchain](https://docs.celo.org/learn/celo-highlights) is a decentralized payment system that can solve the problems of slow payment settlement and high fees. Here's how:

1. **Fast Payments:** The Celo blockchain uses Smart Contracts to process payments. Smart Contracts are like computer programs that can automatically 
execute a transaction when certain conditions are met. This means that payments can be settled almost instantly, without the need for intermediaries. For example, if you want to send money to someone on the Celo blockchain, you can do so in just a few seconds without having to wait several days for the payment to settle.

2. **Cheap Payments:** The Celo blockchain uses stablecoins, which are digital currencies that are pegged to the value of real-world assets, such as 
the US Dollar(USD) or the Euro. This means that the value of stablecoins remains stable, even if the value of other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin fluctuates. Stablecoins can be used to send cross-border payments without the need for intermediaries, which can significantly reduce transaction costs. For example, if you want to send money to someone in another country, you can do so using stablecoins on the Celo blockchain without having to pay high fees to banks and payment processors.

## Advantages of Celo Blockchain:

In addition to solving the problems of slow payment settlement and high fees, the Celo blockchain has several other advantages:

1. **Decentralization:**  means that it is not controlled by a single entity. This makes it more resilient to cyber attacks and censorship.

2. **Financial Inclusion:** which makes it easy for anyone to access financial services, regardless of their income or credit history.

3. **Transparency:** means that all transactions are recorded on a public ledger that anyone can access. This makes it easier to track and audit transactions, which can help prevent fraud and corruption.

4. **Ease of Use:** For developers creating decentralized apps (dApps) on the Celo platform, Celo is designed to be simple to use. It can be simpler for developers to create dApps on the platform because the API has been designed to be easy to integrate into already-existing applications. 

5. **Interoperability:**  refers to the capacity of various blockchain networks to communicate and exchange information with one another. 

## Conclusion: <a name="conclusion"></a> 

Therefore, Celo is a blockchain platform that is focused on solving the problems of slow payment settlement and high fees in traditional payment systems. By using stablecoins and a unique identity system, Celo is able to make it easier and cheaper to send money around the world. If you are tired of high fees and slow transactions, Celo may be the solution you have been looking for.
